              <br/>
                <p>brrrilliant is a consulting and software development services company geared toward startups.</p>
                <p>We are software developers, product managers and entrepreneurs.  We are deeply skilled technologists, but unlike most technologists, we think of technology from the business value that they derive and the internal operations that they support. We have guided businesses for over a decade to tackle new ventures and align IT departments to business drivers.  We entered the startup space to address the lack of expertise and guidance that is available to startups. </p>
                <p>If you’ve been working with developers who don’t think about your current and future business needs, who make technology decisions based on their skills rather than your product, or who simply don’t communicate and manage effectively, you can finally let out a sigh of relief.  You’ve come to the right place. We will be your expert team until your business grows and you’re ready for an in-house expert team.  Don’t be alarmed, we can help you with that too.</p>
                <p>Technologies and Methodologies: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, Ruby, Java, JS, Agile, Lean Startup
